## Technical Considerations

* Declaring global variables is forbidden.
* If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static
functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
* Place all your files at the root of your repository.
* Turning in unused files is forbidden.
* Every **.c** file must compile with the flags **-Wall** **-Wextra** **-Werror**
* You must use the command **ar** to create your library. Using the libtool command is forbidden.
* Your **libft.a** has to be created at the root of your repository.
